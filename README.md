# Stiebel-Eltron heat pump monitor and control. 
And compatible devices.
Connects to WPM2 (and compatible) control unit over optical interface and COM port to the computer.
Windows 32-bit executable. Runs on every machine from XP to Win 11.

## Infrared cable
Short instructions how to build the cable is in the folder "IR_cable_documentation"

## Communication protocol
There was a lot of research done by different people. They mostly focused on connecting directly to the CAN bus that links together all the components of the heat pump. I didn't want to be that intrusive. Optical port allows for all functions that are required without any fear of interference.
Summary of the protocol can be found in the folder "IR_cable_documentation".
Further details (on CAN bus which is very similar) are collected in the folder "Protocol_documentation".
